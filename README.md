# InfoCarAutopilot
This script has been made to give a mere mortal a chance in the competitive market of
getting an exam date on InfoCar that's less than a century away.

It periodically checks for available dates, attempts to make a reservation, and lets the user know when it does with a loud beep.

It does not make the payment on its own, so keep in mind that as per InfoCar's policy, you have 5 minutes after the reservation has been booked to make the payment yourself.

# Setup
Fill out `appsettings.json` with your credentials. If something's pre-filled or `null` you can leave it as is, unless you have a reason for changing it.

With `appsettings.json` filled in with correct values, it should just work after launching.
